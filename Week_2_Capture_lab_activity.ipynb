        "*   Google Colab is built on top of a piece of software called [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). It is used to execute \"**live code\"** and **create** and **share** \"computational documents\" with step-by-step instructions. The code runs on Google's servers, not on your computer, so you don't need to install anything to run it. You can also use Google's massive computational capacity to run complex code with a lot of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The language we will use to code in this course is called [Python](https://www.python.org/), a highly popular programming language within the data science community. It's worth noting that **Python is widely regarded as the easiest programming language for beginners**, and there are numerous online resources available to support your learning journey. This should give you confidence in your ability to grasp the basic concepts.\n",

To **rename your notebook**,  click on the notebook name in the top left corner, and it will be editable, similar to a Google Doc. Like a Google Doc, everything you do in this file is saved automatically to your Google Drive. To **see all your notebooks**, go to your Google Drive and look for the folder \"Colab  Notebooks.\" All your notebooks are automatically saved inside this folder. Also, you can **share your notebook** with others by clicking the \"Share\"  button on the top right.\n",

To **add a new cell**, click on one of the  \"+Code\" or  \"+Text\" buttons located under the file name (top left). A cell will be added under the cell you have currently selected (to select a cell, simply click anywhere on the cell). You can add how many cells you want, delete, move, copy and paste them throughout your notebook. These options are available on the menu that appears at the top right of the cell after you click on that cell. You can also use this menu to clear the output of a cell after a code execution.\n",
